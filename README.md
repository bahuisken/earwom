# Earworm

    ear·worm
    /ˈirˌwərm/
    noun
        1. a catchy song or tune that runs continually through a person's mind.

You have that song stuck in your head, and you can only remember a certain detail about it: A lyric, the title, the album, or the artist. There are several services that allow you to look up songs by this criteria. But earworm is an app that let's you search each of these criteria all in one place. Earworm links you to the full lyrics on Genius, allows you to go to your spotify account to listen. Plus, as there are still music lovers that want to purchase physical media (like vinyl), earworm will direct you to DISCOGS to find that item. Search didn't give you the results you were after? Click the Next button to reveal more results. When you visit Earworm again, your last search in each category is saved, just in case that song is still stuck in your head :)
